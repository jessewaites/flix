      <h5>Hi. Thanks for checking out my site.</h5>
      <p>I'm currently visiting family down south, but will be looking to start a Full Stack jr Ruby on Rails developer job back in Boston towards the end of October. I'd love to hear more about your company and technology stack. I may be a bit green with Rails, but I absolutely love the framework and will be making a career out of it- I have a passion for the web, love to make beautiful and solid technology products, and will endevour every day to be the best developer that I can be.</p>
      <p>You can contact me <a href="mailto: Jesse.Waites@Gmail.com">here at my email address</a>, and you can <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/1wrxjg0dxt19xo5/JWaitesRailsResume.pdf">download my resume here.</a></p>
