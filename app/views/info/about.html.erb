      <h4>Welcome to GeekSocial.</h4>

      <p>So you've found your way to GeekSocial, eh? Great! Thanks for swinging by. I made this site because I wanted a place to show off Rails web design. This particular app has an Event model and a Registration model, with a User model courtesy of Devise. The Event model has_many :registrations and the Registration model belongs_to :event. Most of the logic takes place in the Event controller, with a few methods in the Events Helper as well. (The method that displays the "Sold Out" image for the Rails Hackathon rather than a registration button on the Events Index page resides there.)</p>


      <%= link_to image_tag("lettert.png"), :class => 't' %><br><br><p>he landing page (<%= link_to "with the MacBook and iPhone on the wooden table", root_path %>) was created with a Twitter Bootstrap CDN- I overrode the application html and css files in the controller for that particular static page and imported the Bootstrap stylesheets thanks to the CDN. From there I built a minimalistic landing page with a creative commons background image from Unsplash. This fully responsive demonstration Ruby on Rails app features complete user authentication functionality via the Devise Rails gem. I designed and built the site in Rails 4 with Ruby v1.9.3, while under version control at GitHub. The rest of the front-end (Sans the Bootstrap landing page) was built on the Foundation 4 framework. Google Analytics is installed and reporting <a href="http://railsapps.github.io/rails-google-analytics.html">thanks to the Rails 4 Turbolinks workaround.</a> Typography comes courtesy of Google Fonts- Specifically, the 'Ubuntu' font for the headers and 'Dosis' for the body text. They had to be called through an HTML link in the _header partial because apparently Google Fonts in Rails 4 don't like to render once deployed to Heroku when imported through @importcss.</p>
